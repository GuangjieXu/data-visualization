Regarding my final project, I aim to investigate whether LeBron James' offensive and defensive performance during close-score games in each season of his career is better when he wins compared to when he loses. This inquiry holds significant relevance for LeBron James fans. Throughout James' career, he faced different challenges at various stages. In the early stages, due to the lack of strong teammates, James might have needed to exert himself fully to secure victories. In the mid-stage, with the presence of more talented teammates, he had to consider how to distribute the ball effectively. In the late stage, as his age advanced, he needed to conserve energy to compete for wins, possibly resulting in less noticeable changes in his offensive and defensive performances. Therefore, considering the varying circumstances at different stages, studying LeBron James' performance becomes crucial.

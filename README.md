# Final Project Proposal

In the final project, I will upload the data I used. You can find the data here:https://github.com/GuangjieXu/data-visualization/blob/main/lebron_career_final.csv

At the same time, I will consider creating boxplots for only the most important variables such as scores. Since boxplots are not effective in conveying information when the data size is very small (around 15 games per season with similar scores), I will use the ggplot2 library to draw two radar charts for offense and defense instead. Choosing radar charts can effectively display the specific situations of various variables for LeBron James each season. Therefore, I will consider creating interactive radar charts so that readers can choose a season to view the radar chart. Additionally, I will consider modifying the colors of the charts, using maroon to represent victories and brown to represent losses, to avoid using the original red and green colors, as the combination of these two colors is unfriendly to colorblind individuals and not visually appealing. Furthermore, I will try to write out the full names for the y-axis labels and other necessary labels on the charts as much as possible.

These are the modifications and extensions I made based on feedback. For now, I will only choose to create boxplots for scores and radar charts for offensive and defensive variables, totaling three charts. I will strive to make these charts convey more effective information. Additionally, I will try to write out my paper as fully as possible, explaining all relevant content as clearly as possible.
